    Title: About
    Content: I am a physicist who has worked primarily in the field of quantum computation, 
        in addition to about a year's worth of work each in computational biophysics and quantitative finance. 
        I have a broad and ever evolving range of interests, both professionally and personally.   

        Until January 2024, I was a researcher at the high-frequency trading firm Optiver. 
        Before that, I worked as a postdoc in quantum computing at the [Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory](http://www.lbl.gov "lbl.gov"). 
        You can find out more in my [CV](curriculum-vitae/), or read more about me here.
