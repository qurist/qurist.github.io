##### Abstract

Performing state reversal on a quantum spin chain includes: providing qubits in a quantum spin chain in an input state, such that the quantum spin chain includes: first and second terminal qubits and one or more intermediate qubits, such that: the qubits have a transverse field strength; the first and terminal qubits a longitudinal field strength; and nearest neighbor qubit pair has an Ising coupling strength; and evolving the quantum spin chain from the input state to a final state for an evolution period to perform state reversal on the quantum spin chain.
