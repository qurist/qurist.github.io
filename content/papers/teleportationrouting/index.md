##### Abstract

We study the problem of implementing arbitrary permutations of qubits under interaction con-
straints in quantum systems that allow for arbitrarily fast local operations and classical communication (LOCC). In particular, we show examples of speedups over swap-based and more general unitary routing methods by distributing entanglement and using LOCC to perform quantum teleportation. We further describe an example of an interaction graph for which teleportation gives a logarithmic speedup in the worst-case routing time over swap-based routing. We also study limits on the speedup afforded by quantum teleportation—showing an $O( N \log N )$ upper bound on the separation in routing time for any interaction graph—and give tighter bounds for some common classes of graphs.
