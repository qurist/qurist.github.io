    <h1>Aniruddha Bapat</h1>
    <p> Hi there, visitor! I am a physicist who has worked primarily in the field of quantum computation, 
        in addition to about a year's worth of work each in computational biophysics and quantitative finance. 
        I have a broad and ever evolving range of interests, both professionally and personally.   

        Until January 2024, I was a researcher at the high-frequency trading firm Optiver. 
        Before that, I worked as a postdoc in quantum computing at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. 
        You can find out more in my <a href="/cv">CV</a>, or read more about me <a href="/personal">here</a>.</p>
