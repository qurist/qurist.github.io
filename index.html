    <h1>Hi there, I'm Aniruddha Bapat. Welcome to my website!</h1>
    <p>I am a physicist by training, but have a broad and ever evolving range of academic interests. 
        I would probably be best described as a computational scientist. 
        Until recently, I was a researcher at the high-frequency trading firm Optiver. 
        Before that, I was a postdoctoral scholar in the field of <em>quantum computation</em> at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. 
        You can read more about me <a href="/about">here</a>.</p>
